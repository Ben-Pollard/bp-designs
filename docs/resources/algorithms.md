Branching Systems

L-systems

space colonisation (trees/veins)

diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA)

root-like recursive splitting with tapering

Features: hierarchical structure, controlled randomness, good for corner motifs.

Flow Fields

Perlin/Simplex noise vector fields

Curl noise

Divergence-controlled flows

Features: soft, sweeping motion suitable for borders or subtle textures.

Reaction–Diffusion (Turing Patterns)

Gray–Scott model

Mimicking animal skin patterns

Can be thresholded to create bold shapes

Features: excellent for organic fill textures or repeated motifs.

Iso-surfaces & Metaballs

2D scalar fields

contour extraction (marching squares)

Features: “blobby”, smooth curvature; good as underlying forms that branch systems can grow over.

Tessellations & Cellular Structures

Voronoi diagrams

Lloyd relaxation (smoother cells)

Delaunay triangulations

Hex and quasi-crystal tilings

Features: ideal for border bands, structured grids, subtle background geometry.

Parametric & Harmonic Curves

superformulas

epicycloids/hypocycloids

rose curves

spline families

curvature-controlled spirals

Features: timeless geometry; good for central motifs.

Symmetry & “Almost-Symmetry”

reflection + perturbation

rotational symmetry with noise modulation

fractal symmetry breaking

Features: gives natural imperfection; avoids over-mathematical look.
