Some outputs look like a child's drawing of a tree. That's something.
Some outputs are empty. We would benefit from an analyser. A simple heuristic would work to start with. Ultimately we should aim to cut the human out of the loop by figuring out how to label outputs with beauty estimates.
It's hard to compare without a side-by-side view.
It's hard to say which is more beautiful.
Iterative algos in pure Python are slow.
The generated examples are not as beautiful as examples on the web
The space they are bound in doesn't have to be the same as the canvas
