Run the test suite using pytest with coverage reporting.

Requirements:
- Execute: `poetry run pytest`
- Show coverage report
- If tests fail, analyze the failures and suggest fixes
- Check if any new code is missing tests

After running tests, report:
1. Number of tests passed/failed
2. Coverage percentage
3. Any untested code paths
4. Suggestions for improving test coverage
