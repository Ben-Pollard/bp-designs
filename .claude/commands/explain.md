Provide a detailed explanation of code, concepts, or architecture.

When explaining:
1. Start with a high-level overview
2. Break down into components or steps
3. Explain the "why" behind design decisions
4. Highlight any patterns, best practices, or anti-patterns
5. Suggest improvements if relevant

If no specific code is mentioned, ask what needs explanation:
- A specific function or class
- How a module works
- Architecture decisions
- Design patterns used
- Project structure
